# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

This project is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption algorithm using Python.

## 📌 What is Caesar Cipher?

Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest ciphers, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

## 📂 Features

- Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Decrypt text with the same shift value
- User input for message and shift value
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores non-alphabet characters (punctuation, numbers)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher
